# PYPACK !!!
Just a simple python3 package manager & compiler

known issues
------------
- Somehow, the pypack script will NEVER be able to compile a python file, even when I make it using the working py2elf script

To do:
------
1. Merge everything into the pypack script
2. Add a --update option to update python3 program
3. Add a read me
    - Documentation
    - Fast [cheat sheet](cheat_sheet.md)
4. Create a Makefile
5. Add an option to show all installed packages
6. Make pypack **fool-proof**
7. Ask community to make commits on my script
8. Add support for python3 project that need MULTIPLE files
9. Add some VIM propaganda in easter eggs
