# PYPACK !!!
Just a simple python3 package manager & compiler

Known issues:
------------
- ~Somehow, the pypack script will NEVER be able to compile a python file, even when I make it using the working py2elf script~
    - EDIT : it was just me who was using my own script the wrong way

To do:
------
1. Merge everything into the pypack script
2. Add option to detect python3 version installed
3. Add a --update option to update python3 program
4. Add a read me
    - Documentation
    - Fast [cheat sheet](cheat_sheet.md)
5. Create a Makefile
6. Add an option to show all installed packages
7. Make pypack **fool-proof**
8. Ask community to make commits on my script
9. Add support for python3 project that need MULTIPLE files
10. Add some VIM propaganda in easter eggs
